Following is the iteration numbers (iter), the points where the algorithm calculated the gradient (x), and the gradients of the points (f(x))
iter = 0 , x = 1.000,3.000 , f(x) = -8.000e+02, 4.000e+02
iter = 1 , x = 1.000,1.000 , f(x) = -8.948e-14, 4.441e-14
Status = success
Total number of iterations =   1
