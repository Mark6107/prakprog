1) Where are the files gsl_multimin.h and gsl_multiroots.h?
-I/usr/include

2) What will Makefile do?
make -> Run data and log
Both data and log echoes their name into a file with their name
Then the for-loop is run, where it for both data and log echoes their name, (-n for no \n at end), and then cats the contant of the file with their name

3) Why does make fail with the following error?
It doesn't find the .h file, as the directory it is in is not specified correctly. It needs to both have the right CFLAGS and LDLIBS arguments. And gsl/ in front of gsl_sf.h

4) Why does make fail with the following error?
It needs the LDLIBS references. 

5) Will the following function definition work?
Yes, it defines it locally, and has therefore no trouble?

6) Will the following function definition work?
Yes, defined in local scope

7) Will the following function definition work?
Initially defines the function, and parameters were given before print

8) Will the following function definition work?
No, parameters not given in function call or function definition, other scope.

9) Will call to function work?
Yes, f in scope, and hands its pointer to print_f_of_one

10) Will call to function work?
No, it is a generally defined function, it has no pointer within scopes

11) Explain difference between echo 'argument' and echo `argument`.
'' inserts argument "as string"
`` runs argument in another shell, and returns output

12) Write a C-program that emulates echo.
myecho.c and myecho
