1) How to find declaration of structure in root.c?
gcc -E -P root.c|grep -B8 'gsl_multiroot_fsolver'
-E: Stop after preprocessing. Preprocessed source code sent to stdout
-P: Inhibit generation of linemarkers. Keeps \n and the like, to make it readable?
-B8: print 8 lines before context

2) Find out the declaration of the gsl_multimin_fminimizer structure.
gsl_multimin_fminimizer * s = gsl_multimin_fminimizer_alloc(T,2);
gsl_multimin_fnimizer_set(s,&function,startpoint,stepsize);

3) During multiroot iteration, how can one find the current root and values?
gsl_vector_get(solver->x,0); for root
gsl_vector_get(solver->f,0); for function value

4) During multimin iteration, how can one find current min and value?
gsl_vector_get(solver->x,n); n'th coordinate
gsl_vector_get(solver->f,n); n'th function value (but always only one?)
